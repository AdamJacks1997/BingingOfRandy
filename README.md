One could play this.
One would play this.
One probably shouldn't play this...

Enemies turn into percentage signs when they shoot, this is totally a feature and not a bug.

Sometimes the first room has no doors, this is because you didn't eat your vegetables as a child.

If you walk into a wall, you may hurt your nose - but not in this game.

Sometimes when you get hit the enemy count is multiplied by 10. Definitely not a GUI refresh bug.

I like to imagine the enemies are beers AND FUCKING DESTROY THEM!

If you fall down a hole you will die - this is the same in the game too.

Health is like beer, it's good for you.
